# Tumor Prediction: Malignant or Benign

## Introduction
Breast Cancer is a common cancer among women. It is hard to diagnose this cancer before it is mature and widespread, so researches are now being done by analysing the data of patients collected and finding a pattern in them. Machine learning algorithms can help us diagnose cancer in early stages or even before the occurence and can save a lot of lives.

This project is related to classifying data of a tumour having different features into **benign** and &**malignant**.
